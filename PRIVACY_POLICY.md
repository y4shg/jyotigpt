# JyotiGPT Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2025-08-09

JyotiGPT is an open‑source mobile client for Open‑WebUI. This app acts as a client to a server you choose and configure. This policy describes how the app itself handles data on your device. Your configured server may collect, process, and store data under its own policies; please review your server's privacy terms separately.

## Information We Collect
- Device-stored data: minimal settings and preferences (e.g., theme, UI options) saved locally on your device.
- Authentication tokens: stored securely on your device using platform secure storage when you sign in to your chosen server.
- User-provided content: messages, files, and voice input you choose to send are transmitted directly from your device to your configured server. The app does not operate its own backend.
- Diagnostic information: transient error logs in memory for troubleshooting within a session. The app does not include third‑party analytics.

## How We Use Information
- Operate core features such as chat, file uploads, and voice input.
- Remember your preferences and sign‑in state on this device.
- Improve reliability (e.g., displaying error information to you).

## Data Storage and Transfer
- Local storage: preferences and credentials are stored on your device. Access tokens are stored using secure storage where available.
- Network transfer: when you interact with the app, your data is sent to the server you configured. The app does not send your data to any developer‑controlled servers.

## Permissions
Depending on how you use JyotiGPT, the app may request:
- Microphone: to capture voice input when you opt in.
- Photos/Files: to let you pick and upload attachments.
- Network access: to connect to your configured server.

## Third‑Party Services
The app does not include third‑party analytics or advertising SDKs. Your configured server or extensions you use may rely on third‑party services subject to their own terms.

## Security
We use platform‑provided secure storage for sensitive credentials where supported. No security can be guaranteed; protect access to your device and server credentials.

## Data Retention
- On device: preferences and cached media may persist until you clear app data or uninstall. You can revoke sign‑in by logging out.
- On server: retention is determined by the server you use; consult that server’s policy.

## Your Choices
- You can change servers, log out, or clear app data in your device settings.
- You can choose not to grant optional permissions; some features may not work without them.

## Children’s Privacy
JyotiGPT is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). Do not use the app if you do not meet the applicable age requirements.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy to reflect improvements or legal requirements. Material changes will be reflected in the app bundle and version notes.

## Contact
For questions or requests about this policy, please contact the app maintainer(s) through the project repository.
