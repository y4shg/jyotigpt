What is JyotiGPT?

JyotiGPT is an AI conversational assistant application built around large language models (LLMs) and augmented with domain-specific capabilities (like document reading, translation, summarization, code completion, or accessibility enhancements). The name “Jyoti” suggests “light” or “illumination,” reflecting the goal of illuminating complex topics or guiding users through tasks.

If you’re curious how Jyoti is related to other “Jyoti / Jyoti AI / Jyoti for accessibility” apps — there is a known app “Jyoti – AI for Accessibility” on Google Play and the App Store (developed by TorchIt) for visually impaired users.

However, JyotiGPT is conceptualized as a broader AI assistant (not limited to accessibility), which may incorporate or extend accessibility features.

Key Features

Here are some of JyotiGPT’s envisioned or implemented core features:

Feature	Description
Natural Conversational AI	Engage in fluid, context-aware conversations leveraging LLM backends (e.g. OpenAI GPT, LLaMA, etc.).
Contextual Memory	Remember past messages, allow follow-up questions, maintain conversation context across sessions.
Document & File Understanding	Upload PDFs, images, or text files and ask questions, extract summaries, or translate.
Code Assistance	Auto-complete, debug, explain code snippets for various programming languages.
Multi-Modal Input / Output	Accept voice, images, or screenshots; respond via voice, text, or visual annotation.
Accessibility Tools	(Optional) Features such as OCR, object recognition, color identification to help visually impaired users.
Plugin / Extension Support	Extend the assistant with modular plugins (web search, databases, domain knowledge).
Personalization & Profiles	Enable user-specific preferences, prompt templates, themes, and optional local models.

These features are aspirational; depending on which version or release you have, some may be partial or in progress.

Use Cases & Target Audience

Who can benefit from JyotiGPT?

Students & Learners — for homework help, explanations, summarization, coding assistance.

Professionals — for drafting emails, generating reports, analyzing documents, debugging code.

Writers & Creators — for brainstorming ideas, writing drafts, editing, translation.

Developers & Engineers — as a helper tool in the development workflow.

Individuals with Accessibility Needs — if the app includes accessibility features, it can assist visually impaired users (similarly to Jyoti AI for Accessibility) in reading, object detection, or navigation tasks.

General Knowledge Seekers — for asking questions, exploring topics, or simply conversing.

Use Case Scenarios:

You upload a research paper PDF and ask, “What are the three key contributions?”

You write a draft email, ask JyotiGPT to polish it.

You show a screenshot, and ask, “What does this chart indicate?”

You ask follow-up questions without restating the context (e.g. “And what about in the year 2020?”).

(With accessibility features) You scan your environment via camera and ask Jyoti “What objects are ahead?”

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Before you begin:

A supported OS (macOS, Linux, or Windows)

Node.js, Python, or whichever environment the client and server require

API keys / model access credentials (e.g. OpenAI key)

Git (for cloning repository)

Sufficient compute / GPU resources if you plan on running models locally

Installation / Setup

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-org/jyotigpt.git
cd jyotigpt


Setup backend

cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to add your API keys, database URI, etc.


Setup frontend / client

cd ../frontend
npm install
# or yarn install

Running the App

Run backend server

cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload


Run frontend

cd frontend
npm start


Once both are running, open your browser at http://localhost:3000 (or your configured address) to interact with the JyotiGPT UI.

Usage & Interface

Here’s how users typically interact with JyotiGPT:

Login / Signup

Email/password, OAuth, or magic link.

Optionally enable “anonymous / guest mode”.

Start a Conversation

Type or speak a prompt.

Jyoti GPT responds in streaming mode (token-by-token), showing replies progressively.

Upload / Attach Files

Upload PDFs, images, slides.

Jyoti can parse them and answer questions.

Follow-up & Memory

Ask follow-up queries referencing previous context.

Option to “pin” context or reset memory.

Settings & Preferences

Toggle themes (light / dark)

Choose model (fast vs. high-quality)

Configure temperature, max tokens, etc.

Enable / disable features (e.g. accessibility mode, plugins)

Plugin / Extension Tools

Use built-in tools like web search, translation, math solver, code execution.

Invoke via slash commands or triggers (e.g. /search climate change).

History & Bookmarks

Save favorite conversations or responses

Browse and revisit past sessions

Configuration & Customization

You can tailor JyotiGPT’s behavior via configuration files or UI settings:

Prompt Templates & System Messages
Define system and user prompt templates to adjust tone, style, persona.

Plugin Management
Enable or disable specific integrations (e.g. web search, PDF parsing, WolframAlpha).

Memory Policies
Set how long conversation memory is stored, how to prune history.

Model Parameters
Control temperature, max_tokens, top_p, frequency_penalty, etc.

Appearance
UI fonts, theme colors, layout (compact vs. spacious), accessibility fonts and sizes.

Data Handling, Privacy & Ethics

When building or using an AI assistant, it’s crucial to be transparent and ethical about data and privacy:

User Data Storage

Store user data in encrypted form

Minimize retention; prune old conversations if not needed

Allow users to delete their data

Sensitive Content Filtering

Implement moderation or filtering for harmful, offensive, or unsafe content

Use safe-guard layers or content classifiers

Third-Party APIs & Policies

Comply with terms of service for LLM providers

Ensure appropriate usage limits, logging, and secure key handling

Local vs Remote Inference Trade-Offs

Remote model calls require network transit; local models require compute

Hybrid approaches can allow privacy-preserving on-device processing

Accessibility & Inclusivity

If your app includes accessibility features (like OCR, object detection, text-to-speech), follow standards (WCAG, ARIA)

Always consider equitable access — e.g. offline modes, low-bandwidth fallback

Disclaimer & Transparency

Inform users when responses are AI-generated

Provide disclaimers that the AI may hallucinate or be mistaken

Let users flag or report incorrect content

Testing & Quality Assurance

To ensure reliability and correctness:

Unit Tests
For individual modules (e.g. prompt engineering, file parsing, I/O connectors)

Integration Tests
End-to-end flows (e.g. user uploads PDF → Jyoti answers correct summary)

Regression Tests
Existing questions / prompts should not break with new updates

Human Evaluation & Feedback Loops
Use user feedback to detect hallucinations or errors
Optionally integrate logging and review of “bad responses”

Load / Stress Testing
If multiple users or high concurrency — test throughput, latency, and resource usage

Security Testing
Validate input sanitization, injection attacks, file upload abuse, key handling

Deployment & Distribution

Depending on your target platform:

Mobile (iOS / Android)

Use Apple App Store / Google Play Store

CI/CD pipelines (Fastlane, GitHub Actions)

Handle app review guidelines and data privacy requirements

Web / Desktop

Host frontend and backend (Vercel, Netlify, AWS, GCP, Azure)

Use SSL / HTTPS

Scale backend via container orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)

Edge or On-Device Inference

Optionally bundle a small LLM or quantized model for offline use

Use techniques like model distillation, quantization, or modular fallback

Versioning & Rollouts

Use semantic versioning (v1.0.0, v1.1.0 etc.)

Feature flags or canary deployments for risky changes

Roadmap & Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas and proposed features for future versions:

More domain-specific agents (legal, medical, finance)

Domain adaptation / fine-tuning per user

Plugin marketplace / ecosystem

Improved voice / speech understanding

Multi-lingual support & translation

Visual reasoning (e.g. ask about charts, graphs)

Collaborative / multi-user chat mode

Real-time collaboration (chat + document editing)

On-device quantized models for offline use

Better user onboarding, tutorials & guided prompts

You may want to maintain a public Roadmap.md or “Projects / Issues” board to track planned and in-progress features.
